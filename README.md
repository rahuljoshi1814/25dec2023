# Secure File SharingSystem (25dec2023)
Created A Project on Secure file-sharing system between two different types of user using Flask framework with sql database.Secure File Sharing System between two different tpes of users.
It`s simply file sharing site with python using framework Flask,database SQL with registration,
authorization and own files folder for saving and sharing files . 
In the folder "files" we have all folders of registered users, which includes their own files. In the folder "templates" we can find all the html site pages.
So how works this site? When we starting the app.py we need to open 127.0.0.1:5000 in our web browser and than we can sign up or log in With signing up automaticly creates our own folder with our users name in the folder "files" in the sql database. For operation user he can log in and upload files which would be stored in databased and for the client user they can sign up , log in and download which would be available by operation user.
