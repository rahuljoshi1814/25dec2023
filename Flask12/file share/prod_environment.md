Deploying a secure file-sharing system involves a meticulous approach to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability
1. Code Review and Testing: Ensure the codebase undergoes rigorous security testing, including static and dynamic analysis.
2. Utilize trusted libraries and frameworks for secure development.
3. Assign access rights based on user roles to limit unauthorized access.
4. Encrypt data transmitted between users and the server.
5. Encrypt files stored on servers to prevent unauthorized access even if the data is compromised.
6. Employ secure file transfer protocols like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS.
By integrating these security measures into the deployment process and continuously monitoring and updating them, we can create a robust and secure file-sharing system for the production environment.
